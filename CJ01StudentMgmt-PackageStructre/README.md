# AirTribeStudentMgmtSystem
This folder is for the Project1 at AirTribe StudentMgmtSystem-c16 cohort

Starting with Package Structure part: refer url: AirTribeProjects/CJ01StudentMgmt-PackageStructre at main · farhanvjti/AirTribeProjects

This is mainly a project that helps understanding all the concepts related to multiple package and accessing variables and methods across packages from different classes.

I have also explained access modifiers here, including public, private and default which is package-private.

The following points are covered here:
○ Package Organization (8 points)
■ Create proper package hierarchy: com.airtripe.studentmanagement
■ Implement at least 4 packages: entity, service, util, main
■ Demonstrate package-private, public access across packages
■ Show proper import statements and FQCN usage
