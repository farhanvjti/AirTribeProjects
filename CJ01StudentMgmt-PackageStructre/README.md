# AirTribeStudentMgmtSystem
This folder is for the Project1 at AirTribe StudentMgmtSystem-c16 cohort

Starting with Package Structure part: refer url: AirTribeProjects/CJ01StudentMgmt-PackageStructre at main · farhanvjti/AirTribeProjects

This is mainly a project that helps understanding all the concepts related to multiple package and accessing variables and methods across packages from different classes.

I have also explained access modifiers here, including public, private and default which is package-private.
